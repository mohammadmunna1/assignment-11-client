Over a set base that reminds the ballroom of his palace, with the stairs and red carpet in the front, where the peculiar couple is observed by Lumiere, the castle’s charismatic but rebellious footman, transformed into a candelabra, followed by the butler Cogsworth, transformed into a clock, and the housekeeper Mrs. Potts, and her son Chip, transformed into a teapot and a teacup respectively, with the entire base decorated. Adding to the line that celebrates Disney’s centenary, Iron Studios present the Beauty and the Beast Deluxe – Disney 100th – Disney Classics – Art Scale 1:10 Statue, inspired by Disney’s 30th animated film of theater musical, based on the fairy tale La Belle et la Bête by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont."
